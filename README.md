These functions and files are used to input the data created by the QMD part of PHQMD they mainly rely on the prop_out.dat files that are created by the main function and as such are already average when they are given to these funtions. They output so far the density contributions in graph form and will soon be able to output the density variation that will come with the addition of the asymmetry and the coulomb rectifications in the main functions.
###TO DO LIST
-[] Add the density outputs, and make one generalised plotting file
-[] Add the ability to turn off and on the output of the plots to .png 
-[] Look into the possibility of outputting directly to pdf
-[] Give better names to saved outputs
